### Project Details
Served as **Lead Programmer** at **Gamegine Games** for this helicopter-based shooter project, taking on technical leadership, mentorship, and critical system development roles.

**Technical Leadership & Mentorship:**
* Managed team of 3+ junior/mid-level programmers with hands-on mentorship
* Taught **component-based architecture** and dependency injection patterns
* Conducted code reviews, pair programming, and knowledge sharing sessions
* Trained 3D art team on Unreal Engine workflow and pipeline best practices
* Developed team's technical independence through research & implementation methodologies

**Architecture & System Design:**
* Designed entire software architecture and guided team through implementation
* Established modular, scalable, and maintainable gameplay framework
* Reduced tight coupling and increased code reusability with component-based design
* Created extensible architecture for quest system and game flow management

**AI Systems (Research & Implementation):**
* Researched, taught, and guided implementation of **utility-based AI** system
* Managed third-party AI plugin integration and customization
* Developed **tick batching optimization** system for multi-agent scenarios
* Designed and guided implementation of performance-oriented AI movement patterns for high enemy counts

**Physics-Based Helicopter System:**
* Designed physics-based helicopter flight system and guided team through implementation
* Took ownership of **bug fixing and performance optimization** during production phase
* Refactored flight dynamics, aerodynamics simulation, and control input handling systems
* Researched custom physics engine and developed prototypes (not used in production)

**Weapon & Combat Systems:**
* Designed modular weapon system architecture and **taught developer through implementation**
* Provided research, design, and implementation guidance for **ballistics, hit detection, and damage calculation** systems
* Designed recoil patterns, spread mechanics, and projectile physics systems
* Developed **dismemberment system** (physics-based ragdoll and procedural destruction)

**Procedural Animation & FPS Systems:**
* Developed **procedural FPS animation system** (weapon sway, breathing, recoil)
* Implemented smooth camera transitions with **ADS (Aim Down Sights)** mechanics
* Built **hand sway** and procedural weapon positioning systems
* Created Animation Blueprint architecture and state machine design
* Developed **distance-based animation tick rate optimization** (reducing tick frequency by distance)

**Performance & Optimization:**
* Implemented **object pooling system** and educated team on best practices
* Applied CPU profiling and tick optimization techniques
* Reduced animation overhead with **distance-based animation LOD** system
* Minimized runtime allocations through memory management strategies
* Developed custom solutions and optimization experiments for **Lumen** lighting

**Research & Development:**
* Conducted R&D for custom physics engine integration
* Researched optimization techniques for Lumen rendering system
* Established profiling and benchmarking processes for performance-critical systems
